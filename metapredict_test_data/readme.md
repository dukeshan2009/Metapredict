Testing data. 

These out file are generated by pdb files. We grab the amino acid in order from pdb files and put into these .out files. 

For each amino acid, we also using .dssp file generate the second structure for it. 

These are results for other research. 

My code residue sequence is base on these results. 

Data file with AF*.out is only contain amnio acid name, AF2 PLDDT and second structure. 

Data file with MT*.out in contain Amnio acid name, AF2 PlDDT, MT_plddt, second structure , MSE and MAE.
